---------------- 3.1.3 -----------------------------------------

Released 2021-09-10

- Add -uout flag for UART forwarding to stdout only, with not input and without
  setting up terminal or console in raw mode. Make normal -u cope better with
  stdin not being a console on Windows.

- Fix gptimer interrupt latching problem when interrupts were remapped. Add
  documentation on some current limitations on timer models for GR716 and GR740.

- Add support for getting a callback on events on the interrupt bus for AHB
  modules. Remove the broken intpend callback.

- Limit diagnostic L2 cache accesses from having excessive effects on timing.

---------------- 3.1.2 -----------------------------------------

Released 2021-07-07

- Make default settings more capable. Make SRAM and ROM 8 MiB by default. Enable
  MMU and CASA by default for LEON3. Set number of cache ways to 4 and enabled
  APBUART FIFO with FIFO size 8 by default for LEON3.

- Fix bug where different rounding modes and/or non-standard modes in FPUs of
  different CPUs could spill over from one FPU to another.

- Make the two GRCAN cores connect to the same two CAN buses on GR740.

- Change GRETH PHY ID to be all zeroes.

- Fixes for GRGPIO on GR716. Fix incorrect input enable register reset value.
  Fix bug for logical or/and/xor direction registers. Make data register input
  be zero for bits where directions is set to 1.

- Fix incorrect slave select register reset value and spurious callback on mode
  change for SPICTRL.

- Add missing UART FIFO on GR740.

- Fix problem where GDB could get wrong view on current thread under TSIM thread
  support.

- Fix documentation and example code for mask in AMBA p&p for APB, and expand
  documentation on modules.

---------------- 3.1.1 -----------------------------------------

Released 2021-04-21

- Add TLIB tsim_gdb function for having the TSIM GDB server data stream go via
  user defined functions.

- Make it possible to add AMBA plug&play entries to buses other than the
  processor bus. Fine tune plug&play entries for the various systems.

- Fix -uartX option that was broken in 3.1.0.

- Fix incorrect irq assignment for dac1, dac2 and dac3 on GR716.

---------------- 3.1.0 -----------------------------------------

Released 2021-03-31

- Initial release of TLIB for TSIM3. This is TSIM3 that can be used as a library
  and that can be built into larger simulator frameworks. TLIB has a dedicated C
  API for driving and interacting with the simulation, as well as all the Tcl
  possibilities of standalone TSIM, and support for both loadable and built in
  user modules.

- Support for generating coverage output in the LCOV coverage format.

- Support for custom instructions.

- Support for loading of additional elf section types and better error printouts
  for malformed srec files.

- Improved breakpoint listing and Tcl returns for better scriptability.

- Support for stepping for multiple instructions or for a given amount of time.

- Fix where GDB did always switch to CPU that caused execution halt. Cleanup of
  GDB breakpoints that could be left after a non-extended remote session.

- Made event removal API more intuitive and clear.

---------------- 3.0.2 -----------------------------------------

Released 2020-09-17

- Add symbols clear command and handle implicit symbol clearing better.

- Fix problem with disassembling given address.

---------------- 3.0.1 -----------------------------------------

Released 2020-09-04

- Fix race condition in AT697 PCI example.

- Make disassemble without any arguments properly disassemble from current PC.

- Make inst cope better with negative lengths.

- Fix bug with grethX_dbg all not properly turning on debug output. Add
  grspwX_dbg all for GRSPW cores (UT699).

---------------- 3.0.0 -----------------------------------------

Released 2020-07-02

- Initial release
